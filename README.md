# React Web Final

    DONE---Autoplay next, the next video in the queue starts playing once the current one is finished
    DONE---Users can search for videos and add them to the playlist
    DONE---There's a different url for each playlist that users can share
    DONE---Remove a video from the playlist
       NOTE---Can only remove video from playlist if you are creator of the playlist
    DONE---Persist playlist to api and poll changes from others
       NOTE---Can only test this with Postman or a second window

Ideas for bonus points:

    DONE---Create new playlist from a video
    DONE---Login with Github for user authentication/authorization
       NOTE---The protected routes for React Router aren't really implemented, I realized when I was almost done that people who are not the user will still need to view a playlist without being logged in
